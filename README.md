# giveMeTheLyrics Vue
Give me a song, I'll give you the lyrics.

Super simple but aesthetic Vue Web App that uses Lyrics.ovh API to retrieve the lyrics of a given song.

I decided to redo this project I already build in React to learn Vue without spending time in thinking about the logic or styling of the project in order to just focus on getting used to the Vue way of doing things.

I spent some time playing around with the Spotify API and now you can connect GMTL with your Spotify Account and get the lyrics of your currently playing song in one click. Pretty cool right?

ðŸ¤“ This is my first Vue Project yay! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
