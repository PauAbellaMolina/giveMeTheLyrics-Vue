# giveMeTheLyrics Vue
Give me a song, I'll give you the lyrics.

Super simple but aesthetic Vue Web App that uses Lyrics.ovh API to retrieve the lyrics of a given song.

I decided to redo this project I already build in React to learn Vue without spending time in thinking about the logic or styling of the project in order to just focus on getting used to the Vue way of doing things.

🤓 This is my first Vue Project yay! 🎉🎉🎉
